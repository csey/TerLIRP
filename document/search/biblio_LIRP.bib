	abstract = {This article studies a multi-product and multi-period location-routing-inventory problem in which location-allocation, inventory and routing decisions are to be taken in a three-level supply chain including suppliers, depots and customers. Products are distributed from depots to customers by a homogeneous fleet of vehicles. Backlogging is allowable on condition that the backlog quantity of each customer does not exceed a predefined fraction of his demand. A mixed-integer programming formulation is presented to describe the problem then a new hybrid heuristic algorithm based on the simulated annealing and imperialist competitive algorithm is designed to solve the model. Comprehensive numerical examples are presented to evaluate the efficiency of proposed algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm is compared with simulated annealing algorithm in small and large size instances. The results show that imperialist competitive-simulated annealing (IC-SA) algorithm outperforms simulated annealing (SA) algorithm in terms of solution quality and CPU time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The Inventory Location-Routing Problem with deterministic demand can be seen as an approach to both optimize a supply chain design and minimize its operational costs. This problem considers that vehicles might deliver products to more than one retailer per route and that inventory management decisions are included for a multi-depot, multi-retailer system with storage capacity over a discrete time planning horizon. The problem is to determine a set of candidate depots to open, the quantities to ship from suppliers to depots and from depots to retailers per period, and the sequence in which retailers are replenished by an homogeneous fleet of vehicles. A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to describe the problem and to provide bounds on the solutions. It is strengthened by two sets of valid inequalities with an analysis of their impact. Since the model is not able to solve the targeted instances exactly within a reasonable computation time, a hybrid method, embedding an exact approach within a heuristic scheme, is presented. Its performance is tested over three sets of instances for the inventory location routing, location-routing and inventory-routing problems. Results show important savings achieved when compared to a decomposed approach and the capability of the algorithm to solve the problem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The multi-depot location-routing problem (MDLRP) combines depot location and vehicle routing decisions, in order to determine the locations of depots and find the optimal set of vehicle schedules and routes. Inventory control decisions are interrelated with vehicle routing and depot location. However, the inventory control decisions are always ignored in MDLRP. In this paper, a mathematical model for the single-product multi-depot location-routing problem taking inventory control decisions into consideration is proposed. Since finding the optimal solution(s) for this model is an NP (non-polynomial) problem, we propose a two-phase heuristic method to find solutions for this problem. In phase 1, the initial solution using a route-first, location-allocation second approach based on the minimal system cost (including location, transportation, and inventory costs) is determined. In phase 2, an improvement heuristic search for a better solution based on the initial solution in phase 1 is developed. One sample description is presented for demonstration purposes. At last, the proposed heuristic method is tested and evaluated via simulation. The results show the proposed heuristic method is better than those existing methods without taking inventory control decisions into consideration.},

	abstract = {The combined location routing and inventory problem (CLRIP) is used to allocate depots from several potential locations, to schedule vehicles' routes to meet customers' demands, and to determine the inventory policy based on the information of customers' demands, in order to minimize the total system cost. Since finding the optimal solution(s) for this problem is a nonpolynomial (NP) problem, several heuristics for searching local optima have been proposed. However, the solutions for these heuristics are trapped in local optima. Global search heuristic methods, such as tabu search, simulated annealing method, etc., have been known for overcoming the combinatorial problems such as CLRIP, etc. In this paper, the CLRIP is decomposed into two subproblems: depot location-allocation problem, and routing and inventory problem. A heuristic method is proposed to find solutions for CLRIP. First of all, an initial solution for CLRIP is determined. Then a hybrid heuristic combining tabu search with simulated annealing sharing the same tabu list is used to improve the initial solution for each subproblem separately and alternatively. The proposed heuristic method is tested and evaluated via simulation. The results show the proposed heuristic method is better than the existing methods and global search heuristic methods in terms of average system cost.},

We show that this problem can be formulated as a nonlinear integer programming model, for which we propose a Lagrangian relaxation based solution algorithm. By exploring the structure of the problem, we find a low-order polynomial algorithm for the nonlinear integer programming problem that must be solved in solving the Lagrangian relaxation sub-problems. We present computational results for several instances of the problem with sizes ranging from 40 to 320 customers.
